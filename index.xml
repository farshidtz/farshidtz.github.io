You can run almost anything from scripts to docker containers.</description></item><item><title>Primer: When You Have Too Much to Do</title><link>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/post-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/post-1/</guid><description>You have a to-do list that scrolls on for days. You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.
It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.
How do you keep up with it all? How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate?</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Traveling Ultralight</title><link>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/post-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 12:13:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/post-4/</guid><description>I‚Äôm on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive,‚Äù he said.
I was a little surprised, because though I‚Äôve gotten that comment before, it‚Äôs become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://home.farshid.ws/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://home.farshid.ws/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/about/</guid><description>Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.

I‚Äôve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn‚Äôt. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description></item><item><title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title><link>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/post-2/</guid><description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description></item><item><title>Smartphone Position Detection Using Neural Networks</title><link>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/122/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/122/</guid><description>This project demonstrates an approach to detect common smart phone positions, including ‚ÄúIn Hand‚Äù, ‚ÄúSide Pocket‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn Handbag‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOn Table (Idle)‚Äù. We apply sensor data fusion on a set of hardware- and software-based Android sensors. As a result, data entries containing sensor fusion features are classified individually, without looking at patterns. The overall system design and accuracy are presented using a Google Nexus 6 device.

To ensure a reliable network coverage, service providers spend notable amound of resources to detect blackspots periodically. While relying on user feedbacks is not always an ideal solution due to their hardware specifications, autonomous vehicles can utilized to do the job.

The key features include changing color, size, erasing and saving the image by holding a pointer on the available toolbars.
This application is developed in C++ using the well known OpenCV Library. The application demo and the list of all features are available below:
Control Features with Camera Changing the brush color Changing the brush thickness Clearing the screen Saving the image Closing the application Noise Handing Setting threshold for the maximum distance between two points Getting use of the pointer&amp;rsquo;s area to distinguish between the pointer itself and noises Using a 5x5 Median Filter to reduce the background noise Source Codes https://github.</description></item><item><title>NXT FaceShooter</title><link>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/110/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://home.farshid.ws/posts/110/</guid><description>A Lego Mindstorm robot holding an Android phone is connected to a Windows PC via Bluetooth. The PC receives the phone&amp;rsquo;s camera feeds over WiFi and processes them using OpenCV to detect the human&amp;rsquo;s face. The obtained data is being used in a C++ application and the final commands will be transmitted to the NXT unit to do the shooting.
