Finding missing items has always been troublesome. To tackle the hassle, several systems have been suggested; yet they are inflexible due to excessive setup time, operational cost, and effectiveness. We present Traceband; a lightweight and portable bracelet, which keeps track of every targeted commonly used object that a user interacts with. Users can find the location of missing items via a web-based software portal.
