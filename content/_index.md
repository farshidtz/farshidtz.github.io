# About

I am a software architect and applied researcher, working on challanging issues in the Internet of Things. I design and implement systems that enable interoprability between IoT and Cloud, some of which are open-source as part of [LinkSmart](https://github.com/linksmart). Moreover, I co-author the [W3C Web of Things (WoT) Discovery](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery) specification, aimed at standardizing IoT service discovery across various protocols.
