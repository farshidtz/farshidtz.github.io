# About

I design and implement systems that enable interoperability between IoT and Cloud, most of which are open-source as part of [LinkSmart](https://github.com/linksmart) and [EdgeX](https://github.com/edgexfoundry).
I co-author the [W3C Web of Things (WoT) Discovery](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/) specification, aimed at standardizing IoT service discovery across various protocols.
My current focus is on making IoT software deployment easier and more secure.
